## LOG ENTRY [2025-01-17]: Updated Project Setup and Planning – Key Domains for Assessing Paraprofessional Readiness

- **Evolving Focus:**  
  Originally conceived to assess paraprofessional readiness for working with adolescents, the focus expanded to working with adolescents and adults in educational and healthcare settings. This clarification emphasizes that the trainees are adults who will be working with both populations.

- **Purpose of the Assessment:**  
  Evaluate the core competencies required for paraprofessionals, establishing a baseline for applicants while identifying training needs.

- **Eight Essential Domains (Ranked by Importance):**  
  1. **Emotional Regulation & Stress Tolerance:**  
     - Prevents burnout, impulsive reactions, and escalation.
  2. **Communication & Active Listening:**  
     - Reduces conflict, builds trust, and prevents boundary violations.
  3. **Basic Literacy & Numeracy:**  
     - Determines how quickly candidates can acquire additional skills and is vital for specific training on data collection and progress monitoring.
  4. **Ethical & Professional Boundaries:**  
     - Critical for impulse control and for recognizing and implementing proper professional conduct, especially once the foundational skills are in place.
  5. **Behavior Management & Crisis De-Escalation:**  
     - Essential for handling acute situations; while trainable, it builds on strong emotional regulation and communication.
  6. **Trauma-Informed Care & Mental Health Awareness:**  
     - Important for understanding and addressing the needs of at-risk populations; a skill that can be developed with targeted training.
  7. **Data Collection & Progress Monitoring:**  
     - Relies on literacy/numeracy skills; vital for accountability and tracking progress.
  8. **Disability Awareness (IDEA’s 13 Disability Categories & DSM-V):**  
     - Though critical, it was ranked last as ongoing training will help employees acquire these concepts over time.

- **Rationale Behind the Ranking:**  
  - The top three domains—Emotional Regulation, Communication, and Basic Literacy & Numeracy—were deemed essential because they enable new hires to quickly adapt and understand the other domains.  
    - **Emotional Regulation:** Skills such as managing impulsivity directly influence the ability to recognize and implement professional boundaries.  
    - **Communication:** Effective communication is crucial for addressing behavior management and crisis de-escalation scenarios promptly.  
    - **Basic Literacy & Numeracy:** These foundational skills are necessary for specific training on data collection and monitoring, ensuring that candidates can handle technical aspects of the role.  
  - Disability Awareness, though important, is ranked last since employees with ongoing training are expected to acquire these concepts on the job.  
  - The categorization of these domains draws on frameworks from both IDEA and the DSM-V.

## LOG ENTRY [2025-01-24]: Assessment Tool Selection for Emotion Regulation

- **Context & Objective:**  
  Evaluated various emotion regulation assessments—each validated in peer-reviewed studies—to determine which tool best captures the multifaceted aspects of emotion regulation critical for paraprofessional readiness in high-stress environments.

- **Assessments Considered:**  
  1. **Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ):**  
     - **Description:** A 10-item self-report measure assessing cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression (Gross & John, 2003).  
     - **Relevance:** Widely used to understand emotion management strategies.
  2. **Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS):**  
     - **Description:** A 36-item instrument evaluating dimensions such as nonacceptance, impulse control, goal-directed behavior, emotional awareness, access to strategies, and clarity.  
     - **Relevance:** Especially useful in clinical settings and directly relevant for managing high-stress situations in paraprofessional roles.  
     - **Scoring:** Utilizes a Likert scale where lower scores indicate greater adaptability.
  3. **Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ):**  
     - **Description:** A 36-item questionnaire measuring nine cognitive coping strategies.  
     - **Relevance:** Focuses on cognitive aspects of emotion regulation.
  4. **Emotion Regulation Inventory (ERI):**  
     - **Description:** Measures three styles of emotion regulation (autonomous, controlled, impersonal) based on self-determination theory.
  5. **Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ):**  
     - **Description:** A 20-item measure assessing the use of social interactions to regulate emotions.

- **Selection & Rationale:**  
  The **DERS** was selected due to its comprehensive coverage of emotion regulation facets and its direct relevance to the real-world demands on paraprofessionals working with emotionally volatile populations.

## LOG ENTRY [2025-01-24]: Communication Assessment Tool Evaluation

- **Theoretical Framework:**  
  - Explored various communication theories with emphasis on Habermas' theory of communicative action (Habermas, 2015), which differentiates strategic communication from communication aimed at understanding.

- **Models and Assessments Considered:**  
  - **Affective Communication Assessment (ACA):**  
    - Focuses on emotional expression and understanding for individuals with complex communication needs.
  - **Checklist of Communication Competence (Triple C):**  
    - Evaluates communication skills across five stages using structured observations and tasks.
  - **Communication Matrix:**  
    - Assesses communication functions across seven levels, particularly for individuals with complex needs.

- **Comparative Evaluation:**  
  - **Communicative Competence Scale (CCS):**  
    - Composed of 36 Likert-scale items assessing the ability to choose appropriate communicative behaviors.
  - **Final Selection – Interpersonal Communication Competence Scale (ICCS):**  
    - **Structure:** A 30-item self-report instrument evaluating ten dimensions: self-disclosure, empathy, social relaxation, assertiveness, interaction management, altercentrism, expressiveness, supportiveness, immediacy, and environmental control.  
    - **Measurement:** Uses a 5-point Likert scale.  
    - **Rationale:** Chosen for its strong psychometric properties and relevance for paraprofessionals.

LOG ENTRY [2025-02-10]: Database Table Population & Dummy Data Script Development

Data Population Strategy:

Used a dummy script to generate a larger dataset by merging existing collected data with additional datasets that provided standard scores corresponding to gender, age, and education.
Data for some roles was initially labeled "Other" and then manually updated for Administrators, Therapists/Teachers, and Paraprofessionals.
Script and Package Setup:

Installed psycopg2-binary: pip install psycopg2-binary

Used DBeaver for database review.

Schema Adjustments:

Added submission_uuid column to link assessments uniquely: 

ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN submission_uuid UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid();

Added age_range column: 

ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN age_range VARCHAR(10);

Adjusted education column length: 

ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN education VARCHAR(255);

Data Population Script:

Developed a Python script using psycopg2, Faker, and random to:

Clear the table and reset the sequence.

Generate data for demographics and assessment scores (DERS, ICCS, Literacy, Math).
Insert the data into the participants table.
A code snippet from the script:

Database connection setup
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://<credentials>@<host>:<port>/<database>"

fake = Faker()
total_women = 260
total_men = 97
total_participants = total_women + total_men

Updated the Flask webhook endpoint (/webhook) to receive JSON payloads from various forms (DERS, ICCS, Literacy-Numeracy).
Implemented safe key access in the insert_data() function to handle missing fields without crashing the update queries.
Corrected the SQL queries to use the correct column name (submission_uuid) for record matching.
Tested the API using PowerShell (Invoke-RestMethod) and cURL; received success responses with the expected UUID (e.g., "7700c142-fcc1-4cd8-a462-1aab42a8e1a3").
2. Debugging and Form Integration

Encountered issues with malformed JSON and extra newline characters when testing in Postman; resolved these by ensuring the URL was typed exactly (without trailing newlines) and by using here-strings or ConvertTo-Json for payload construction.
Used the Postman Console to inspect request details, confirming that the correct headers (Content-Type: application/json) and properly formatted JSON are being sent.
Monitored Heroku logs to verify that incoming POST requests are reaching the endpoint and being processed as expected.
3. Extending Functionality for the DERS Form

Modified the insert_data() function to optionally accept extra fields for DERS submissions.
For the DERS form, updated the SQL UPDATE statement to also set top-level fields: gender, education_level, and age_range, based on values passed in the JSON payload.
Adjusted the webhook endpoint to extract these extra fields from the request and pass them to the insert_data() function when form_type is "ders".
Testing confirmed that while ICCS and Literacy-Numeracy submissions update as expected, the DERS form now also includes these additional fields when provided.
4. Current Status and Next Steps

The API is successfully deployed on Heroku and processes JSON payloads for all form types, updating the corresponding database record (using the provided UUID).
Manual testing via Postman and PowerShell has confirmed successful updates for ICCS and Literacy-Numeracy; additional testing for DERS with the extra fields is ongoing.
Next Steps:
Integrate the live Forminator forms on the WordPress site with the API endpoints.
Continue monitoring Heroku logs and verifying updates via DBeaver to ensure that all fields (including gender, education_level, and age_range for DERS) are correctly updated.
Consider implementing an upsert mechanism if needed, so that a record is created if one does not exist for a given UUID.
